1. update serial column 

When one or more rows are deleted, serial columns will no longer be continous in numbering. For example, 
if row number 5 is deleted from row numbers 1...10, the resulting serial column will be 1...4, 6...10.
To regenerate serial column 1...9 (10 - 1 = 9), use the following queries:

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE test.testtb2_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
UPDATE test.testtb2 SET id = DEFAULT;
```

2. random row selection from serial column

Because serial column has non-empty index number from 1 to n, a random row selection can be done by
querying the row that has a id randomly generated between 1 to n.

```sql
/* Suppose the serial column is named ID in postgresql*/
SELECT * FROM schema.table
WHERE "ID" = (SELECT CASE WHEN "ID" = 0 THEN 1 ELSE "ID" END
FROM (SELECT ROUND(RANDOM() * (SELECT MAX("ID") FROM schema.table)) as "ID") as r);
```
